#### Logic chip design: Advanced CPUs

Central processing units ("CPUs") are the dominant general purpose logic chips. Two U.S. firms, Intel and AMD, have long held a duopoly over CPUs used for laptops, desktops, and servers. (China has several ventures, though none are competitive with U.S. firms.) CPUs are often classified into "nodes," which represent technology generations: a chip at a new node (e.g., "5 nm‚" released in 2020) contains approximately double the transistor density as a previous node (e.g., "7 nm‚" released in 2018) and is also more cost-effective.
