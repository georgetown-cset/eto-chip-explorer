Logic chip design: Advanced CPUs,N1,process,Design,S1,"Central processing units (""CPUs"") are the dominant general purpose logic chips. Two U.S. firms, Intel and AMD, have long held a duopoly over CPUs used for laptops, desktops, and servers. (China has several ventures, though none are competitive with U.S. firms.) CPUs are often classified into ""nodes,"" which represent technology generations: a chip at a new node (e.g., ""5 nm‚"" released in 2020) contains approximately double the transistor density as a previous node (e.g., ""7 nm‚"" released in 2018) and is also more cost-effective.",$56.2 billion (microprocessors) (2019),,"[CSET](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/the-semiconductor-supply-chain/) (citing SIA, IC Insights, TrendForce, financial statements)"
Logic chip design: Discrete GPUs,N2,process,Design,S1,"Discrete graphics processing units (""GPUs"") have long been used for graphics processing (for example, in video game consoles) and in the last decade have become the most used chip for training artificial intelligence algorithms. The United States monopolizes the design market for GPUs, including standalone ""discrete GPUs,"" the most powerful GPUs.",$11.9 billion (2019),,"[CSET](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/the-semiconductor-supply-chain/) (citing SIA, IC Insights, TrendForce, financial statements)"
