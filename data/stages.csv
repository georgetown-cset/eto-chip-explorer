S1,Design,"Semiconductor design involves specification, design, physical design, and validation and verification. Specification determines how the chip should operate in the system using it. Design creates a schematic model of interconnected electrical components. Physical design translates this model to a physical layout of electrical components and interconnects, the wires that connect components. Validation and verification ensure chips based on the design will operate as expected. Semiconductor design can be subdivided into three broad categories: logic, memory, and DAO (discrete, analog, and other).",$574 billion (2022),Chart shows market shares for the overall global semiconductor design market by country.,"[Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)](https://perma.cc/GT6R-SWEM) and World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS)](https://perma.cc/Y773-9T3A, https://perma.cc/UH5R-G63P)"
S2,Fabrication,"Fabrication turns designs into chips. Semiconductor fabrication facilities (""fabs"") make chips in these wafers in two steps: forming transistors and other electrical devices in material layers within silicon wafers; and forming metal interconnects between the electrical devices in insulating layers above the silicon. There are two business models for fabs: (1) fabs owned by integrated device manufacturers (""IDMs""), which manufacture chips based on their own designs; and (2) foundries, i.e., fabs operating independently and manufacturing chips for third-party customers. Firms headquartered in the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and China control the vast majority of the world's fab market share. In 2022, fab capacity was concentrated in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan (highest to lowest). Advanced logic fab capacity (<10nm) was located solely in Taiwan and South Koreaâ€”controlled by TSMC and Samsung, respectively. As of 2024, two firms are newly capable of fabricating advanced logic: Intel (headquartered in the United States) and SMIC (headquartered in China). Advanced logic capacity is expected to diversify by 2032, with fabs located in the United States, Japan, Europe, and China.",,"Chart shows share of global fabrication capacity (for logic, memory, and DAO devices) by site location.",[Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)](https://perma.cc/GT6R-SWEM)
S3,"Assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP)","At the end of the fabrication process, the finished wafer contains dozens of chips in a grid pattern. During assembly, testing, and packaging, the wafer is separated into individual chips, or ""dies."" Each chip is mounted on a frame with wires that connect the chip to external devices, and enclosed in a protective casing. This produces the familiar look of a dark gray rectangle with metal pins at the edges. The chip is also tested to ensure it operates as intended. Although ATP was historically low value, as transistor densities in logic chips have increased exponentially, packaging has increasingly become a bottleneck on chip performance. ATP occurs under two business models: (1) as in-house ATP services performed by integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and foundries after fabrication; and (2) by outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) firms, which perform ATP for third-party customers. Facilities located in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan have the largest site capacity to provide ATP services.",$95 billion (2022),Chart shows ATP site capacity by country.,[Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)](https://perma.cc/GT6R-SWEM)
