S1,Design,"Logic chip design involves specification, logic design, physical design, and validation and verification. Specification determines how the chip should operate in the system using it.  Logic design creates a schematic model of interconnected electrical components. Physical design translates this model to a physical layout of electrical components and interconnects, the wires that connect components. Validation and verification ensure chips based on the design will operate as expected.

The United States designs most of the world’s logic chips, with South Korea, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, and China each capturing small shares. High-value categories in logic chip design include high-end CPU design, discrete GPU design, FPGA design, and AI ASIC design."
S2,Fabrication,"Fabrication turns designs into chips. Semiconductor fabrication facilities (“fabs”) make chips in these wafers in two steps: forming transistors and other electrical devices in material layers within silicon wafers; and forming metal interconnects between the electrical devices in insulating layers above the silicon.

There are two business models for fabs: (1) fabs owned by integrated device manufacturers (""IDMs""), which manufacture chips based on their own designs; and (2) foundries, i.e., fabs operating independently and manufacturing chips for third-party customers. Firms headquartered in the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and China control the vast majority of the world’s fab market share and fab capacity—most of which is also physically located in these countries. Three firms – headquartered in the United States (Intel), Taiwan (TSMC), and South Korea (Samsung) – control virtually all of the world’s advanced logic fab capacity, with the most cutting-edge fabs concentrated in Taiwan and South Korea."
S3,"Assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP)","Assembly, testing, and packaging starts with cutting a finished wafer—which contains dozens of chips in a grid pattern after fabrication—into separate chips. Each chip is mounted on a frame with wires that connect the chip to external devices, and enclosed in a protective casing. The chip is also tested to ensure it operates as intended. Although ATP was historically low value, as transistor densities in logic chips have increased exponentially, packaging has increasingly become a bottleneck on chip performance.

ATP occurs under two business models: (1) as in-house ATP services performed by integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and foundries after fabrication; and (2) by outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) firms, which perform ATP for third-party customers. Firms headquartered in Taiwan, the United States, China, and South Korea are the main providers of ATP services."
