Logic chip design: Advanced CPUs,N1,process,,,Design,S1,"Central processing units (""CPUs"") are the dominant general purpose logic chips. Two U.S. firms, Intel and AMD, have long held a duopoly over CPUs used for laptops, desktops, and servers. (China has several ventures, though none are competitive with U.S. firms.) CPUs are often classified into ""nodes,"" which represent technology generations: a chip at a new node (e.g., “5 nm” released in 2020) contains approximately double the transistor density as a previous node (e.g., “7 nm” released in 2018) and is also more cost-effective.  "
Logic chip design: Discrete GPUs,N2,process,,,Design,S1,"Discrete graphics processing units (""GPUs"") have long been used for graphics processing and in the last decade have become the most used chip for training AI algorithms. The United States monopolizes the design market for GPUs, including standalone “discrete GPUs,” the most powerful GPUs."
Logic chip design: FPGAs,N3,process,,,Design,S1,"Field-programmable gate arrays (""FPGAs""), unlike other chips, can be reprogrammed after deployment to suit specific calculations, such as executing AI algorithms. U.S. firms capture virtually the entire FPGA design market."
Logic chip design: AI ASICs,N4,process,,,Design,S1,"Application-specific integrated circuits for artificial intelligence (""AI ASICs"") often achieve greater speed and efficiency for artificial intelligence than GPUs and FPGAs, but are usable only for specific AI algorithms. ASICs can be easier to design than CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, opening the field to a wide range of design startups, including in China. Still, few highly specialized ASICs have been widely commercialized, as their markets are often too small for recouping fixed development costs."
Crystal growing furnaces,N8,tool_resource,Lower,,,,"Crystal growing furnaces and machining tools are necessary to produce all wafers—thin, disc-shaped materials fabs used to produce chips. The furnace forms a cylindrical ingot of silicon from polycrystalline raw silicon; machining equipment then cuts the ingot into wafers used for chip fabrication. These tools have relatively lower value and complexity relative to other SME. Japan, Germany, and Switzerland are the main producers."
Crystal machining tools,N9,tool_resource,Lower,,,,"Crystal growing furnaces and machining tools are necessary to produce all wafers—thin, disc-shaped materials fabs used to produce chips. The furnace forms a cylindrical ingot of silicon from polycrystalline raw silicon; machining equipment then cuts the ingot into wafers used for chip fabrication. These tools have relatively lower value and complexity relative to other SME. Japan, Germany, and Switzerland are the main producers."
Wafer bonding and aligning tools,N10,tool_resource,,,,,"Wafer bonders and aligners join silicon wafers. In this visualization, these tools are included in the wafer manufacturing process preceding chip fabrication, but they may also be used after chips are fabricated in the wafers. Austria, Germany, and the United States produce this equipment"
Wafer handlers,N11,tool_resource,Lower,,,,"Wafer and photomask handlers store and transport wafers and photomasks in a fab. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and France produce these relatively less complex tools."
Photomask handlers,N12,tool_resource,Lower,,,,"Wafer and photomask handlers store and transport wafers and photomasks in a fab. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and France produce these relatively less complex tools."
Wafer marking systems,N13,tool_resource,Lower,,,,"Wafer marking systems are relatively less complex tools that mark wafers, or chips manufactured in wafers, with identifiers using a laser."
Ion implanter,N17,tool_resource,,,,,"Ion implanters embed dopant substances into silicon wafers to give different parts of the wafer different levels of semiconductivity to make functional transistors in chips. Different types of implanters are used for different purposes. Low-to-medium-current ion implanters and high-current ion implanters are most commonly used, with high-current ion implanters capable of greater throughput. Meanwhile, high-voltage ion implanters can implant ions deeply into silicon, and ultra-high-dose doping implanters can achieve greater dopant density than the other tools. The United States is the dominant producer of ion implanters, with Japan and Taiwan rounding out most of global market share."
Advanced photolithography equipment,N19,tool_resource,,,,,"The Netherlands, Japan, and a small number of other countries are the dominant producers of lithography equipment, critical for the production of chips and photomasks. In particular, the Netherlands and Japan are exclusive providers of advanced photolithography equipment, necessary for mass-production of advanced chips."
EUV scanners,N20,tool_resource,,,,,"Photolithography scanners use ultraviolet light to draw intricate, nanoscale patterns into semiconductor wafers, creating the billions of tiny circuits contained in a single advanced logic chip. An extreme ultraviolet (EUV) scanner refracts a beam of 13.5 nm ultraviolet light through a photomask, transferring that pattern to a photoresist chemical applied as a layer on the chip. The light dissolves parts of the photoresist in the circuit pattern. The newly created photoresist pattern is etched into a permanent chip substrate below the photoresist. Throughout this process, the scanner precisely moves the wafer and the photomask help build the design.

EUV scanners are the most advanced photolithography equipment currently used in mass semiconductor production. They are the only tools combining leading-edge precision (by producing light with small wavelengths) with high throughput (by using photomasks), and are necessary for mass-producing the most advanced logic chips. They are exclusively built by the Dutch firm ASML. A single EUV scanner costs well over $100 million, ships in 40 freight containers and contains about 100,000 individual parts."
ArF scanners,N21,tool_resource,,,,,"Photolithography scanners use ultraviolet light to draw intricate, nanoscale patterns into semiconductor wafers, creating the billions of tiny circuits contained in a single advanced logic chip. Argon fluoride (ArF) scanners and argon fluoride immersion scanners refract 193 nm ultraviolet light through a photomask, transferring that pattern to a photoresist chemical applied as a layer on the chip. The light dissolves parts of the photoresist in the circuit pattern. The newly created photoresist pattern is etched into a permanent chip substrate below the photoresist. Throughout this process, the scanner precisely moves the wafer and the photomask help build the design.

ArF and ArF immersion scanners are among the most advanced photolithography equipment currently used in mass semiconductor production, second only to EUV scanners. EUV and ArF immersion scanners are the only lithography tools capable of mass-producing chips at near-cutting edge scale (the absolute cutting edge requires EUV). Only the Dutch firm ASML and the Japanese firm Nikon produce ArF and ArF immersion scanners capable of mass production."
ArF immersion scanners,N22,tool_resource,,,,,"Photolithography scanners use ultraviolet light to draw intricate, nanoscale patterns into semiconductor wafers, creating the billions of tiny circuits contained in a single advanced logic chip.

Only the Dutch firm ASML and the Japanese firm Nikon produce ArF and ArF immersion scanners capable of mass production."
Photolithography,N25,process,,,Fabrication,S2,"In photolithography, light is used to draw patterns into semiconductor wafers, creating the tiny circuits that comprise logic chips. A photolithography tool passes light through a photomask—a transparent plate with a circuit pattern—to transfer that pattern to a wafer coated with photoresist chemical. (Photomasks are themselves made with lithography tools.) The light dissolves parts of the photoresist according to the circuit pattern.

Advanced photolithography is critical to mass production of the most advanced semiconductors, and requires enormously complex, expensive equipment supplied by only a few vendors in Europe and Japan. The most sophisticated photolithography processes involve extreme ultraviolet (EUV) scanners, produced exclusively by the Dutch firm ASML."
Wafer,N26,material_resource,,"Including marking and handling, crystal growing and machining",,S2,"In wafer manufacturing, a furnace forms a cylinder of silicon (or other semiconducting materials), which is then cut into disc-shaped wafers. These wafers are then processed, split and packaged into individual chips. Most wafers are made purely of silicon or another material, but others have more complex structures.  Dopants, such as boron, aluminum, phosphorous, platinum or other elements, may be added to alter the level of semiconductivity.

300 mm wafers, produced by Japanese, Taiwanese, German, and Korean firms, are used to produce nearly all advanced chips today. Manufacturing the smoothest, high-purity 300 mm wafers—which are necessary for supporting the smallest chip feature sizes—requires considerable tacit know-how. Older-technology wafer sizes include 150 and 200 mm, used for chips with larger feature sizes."
Maskless lithography equipment,N28,tool_resource,,,,,"Maskless lithography equipment draws patterns in a substrate using laser light, electrons, or ions. Unlike photolithography equipment, maskless lithography tools work without masks. This allows them to quickly and cheaply make new patterns, but makes the process of drawing patterns slower. As a result, maskless lithography tools can cost-effectively produce low-volume items like photomasks, but are are ill-suited to mass chip production."
Electron-beam lithography tools,N29,tool_resource,,,,,"Electron-beam (or ""e-beam"") lithography equipment draws patterns in a substrate using electrons. They are the dominant tools for photomask production, and are also infrequently used for low-volume chip production."
Laser lithography tools,N30,tool_resource,,,,,Laser lithography equipment draws patterns in a substrate using laser light. They are sometimes used to produce photomasks (though less often than e-beam tools).
Photoresist,N31,material_resource,,,,,"Photoresists are chemicals deposited on a wafer that, when exposed to patterned light that has passed through a photomask, selectively dissolve to form the circuit pattern. Etching is then performed in places where the photoresist has dissolved to transfer the circuit pattern permanently onto the wafer. Photoresists are specific to particular photolithography processes. Japanese firms are the leading producers."
Resist processing tools,N32,tool_resource,,,,,"Resist processing tools, also called ""tracks,"" coat photoresists on wafers (typically by spin-coating, which spins the wafer to spread deposited photoresist), develop them (dissolve portions hit by light), and bake them (harden undissolved photoresist to prepare for etching). Japan is the sole producer of the most advanced tracks for EUV and ArF immersion photolithography; Germany, South Korea, the United States, and China produce less advanced equipment."
Advanced photomask,N33,material_resource,,,,,"Photomasks are transparent plates containing a circuit pattern to be fabricated in a chip. Photolithography equipment produces light that passes through this pattern so that the photomask’s pattern is transferred to the chip.  Each photomask is specific to one chip design (itself specific to a node). Photomasks are produced by captive mask shops (businesses within large semiconductor manufacturing firms) or merchant mask shops (which sell to semiconductor manufacturers). Japan, the United States, Taiwan, and South Korea lead production of leading-edge photomasks."
Deposition,N35,process,,,Fabrication,S2,"In the deposition process, specialized tools are used to deposit thin films of materials on a silicon wafer. After lithography and etching, these films become different chip layers, including for transistors, interconnects (wires), and other elements. "
Deposition tools,N36,tool_resource,,,,,"Deposition tools are used to deposit thin films of materials on a silicon wafer. After lithography and etching, these films become different chip layers, including for transistors, interconnects (wires), and other elements."

Low-pressure CVD tools,N39,tool_resource,,,,,"Low-pressure CVD tools are commonly used to deposit polysilicon, tungsten, titanium, and titanium nitride."
High-temperature CVD tools,N40,tool_resource,,,,,High-temperature CVD tools are used to deposit epitaxial layers (layers oriented in a particular way relative to underlying layers).

Physical vapor deposition tools,N42,tool_resource,,,,,"Physical vapor deposition (PVD) tools vaporize a solid or liquid material, which then condenses onto a substrate. The primary PVD method is called ""sputtering."" The United States controls the PVD equipment market, with Japan capturing most of the rest."
Rapid thermal processing tools,N43,tool_resource,,,,,"Rapid thermal processing (RTP) tools include lamps, lasers, or other mechanisms to quickly increase the temperature of a wafer in order to change its properties. For instance, RTP tools are used to activate materials (such as dopants in transistors) to change their properties, modify materials, or make deposited films denser to improve their properties.

RTP tools include two submarkets: conventional tools provide heat for as long as multiple seconds (solely produced by the United States and South Korea); and other tools provide it only for milliseconds (solely produced by the United States and Japan)."
Tube-based diffusion and deposition tools,N44,tool_resource,,,,,"Tube-based diffusion and deposition systems are called “tube”-based because substrates are loaded in cylindrical chambers for processing, either causing  diffusion of dopants into a wafer (tube diffusion systems) or depositing materials for particular applications (tube deposition systems)."
Electrochemical coating tools,N45,tool_resource,,,,,"Electrochemical coating tools use electrolysis to deposit materials. A common application is to deposit copper (used for wiring in chips) across a wafer. However, other techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition, can also deposit copper for some applications. "
Etch and clean,N46,process,,,Fabrication,S2,"After photolithography creates a pattern in the photoresist coating a wafer, specialized tools etch the pattern into the permanent layer below the photoresist. The photoresist is then removed and the etched material cleaned off of the layer. "
Chemical vapor deposition tools,N47,tool_resource,,,,,"Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) tools create a chemical vapor that deposits films on the wafer atom-by-atom or molecule-by-molecule. CVD is the most widely used deposition technique in chip fabrication. It is used to deposit most dielectrics (a type of insulator), silicon, and some metals. "
Dry etching and cleaning tools,N48,tool_resource,,,,,"Etching and cleaning tools have two main types: dry and wet. Dry etching tools—using gases to etch the substrate—are the most commonly used tool, and are especially necessary for circuit features in advanced chips. Dry etching tools have advantages over wet tools: they are fast and can etch differently depending on the direction of etch (""anisotropic etching""), which enables fine-grained features with complex shapes.

The most advanced dry etching tools are called atomic layer etching (ALE) tools. These tools are important for multiple etching applications in the most advanced chips, and are produced by leading U.S., Japanese, and British firms."
Wet etching and cleaning tools,N49,tool_resource,,,,,"Etching and cleaning tools have two main types: dry and wet. Wet etching tools, using liquids, are less commonly used, and largely for cleaning wafers. Wet etching has advantages compared to dry etching—it is cheaper, risks less damage to substrates, and is more selective, i.e., it can etch a particular material without unintentionally etching nearby materials. However, it is slower and typically cannot etch differently depending on the direction of etch, making it difficult to form complex structures. Therefore, wet etching is not typically used for etching the smallest features in advanced chips."
Conductor etching tools,N50,tool_resource,,,,,The main types of dry etching tools are used either for etching conductors or dielectrics. Major subtypes of conductor and dielectric dry etching tools include sputter etching and plasma etching; plasma etching is further divided into reactive ion etching and deep reactive ion etching (a form of reactive ion etching used to make deep wells). The most commonly used form is reactive ion etching.
Dielectric etching tools,N51,tool_resource,,,,,The main types of dry etching tools are used either for etching conductors or dielectrics. Major subtypes of conductor and dielectric dry etching tools include sputter etching and plasma etching; plasma etching is further divided into reactive ion etching and deep reactive ion etching (a form of reactive ion etching used to make deep wells). The most commonly used form is reactive ion etching.
Ion milling tools,N52,tool_resource,Lower,,,,"Ion milling tools are a less critical segment of dry etch and clean tooling, used to etch certain specific features on wafers."
Etching and cleaning tools,N55,tool_resource,,,,,"Etching tools are responsible for creating permanent patterns in chips: after photolithography removes portions of a photoresist deposited on a wafer in a precise pattern, etching tools etch that pattern into a permanent substrate below. Cleaning tools then remove etched materials.

The United States and Japan are the main producers of etch and clean equipment; South Korea and China are also significant producers."
Chemical mechanical planarization,N57,process,,,Fabrication,S2,"After other steps like etching and cleaning, the wafer surface is flattened in a process called chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) to allow a new layer of features to be added. CMP tools are critical for chip fabrication, but not as complex as other tools, such as lithography and deposition tools."

General-purpose microscopy tools,N68,tool_resource,,,,,General-purpose microscopes used in semiconductor manufacturing include scanning electron microscopes and transmission electron microscopes.
Assembly and packaging,N69,process,,,"Assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP)",S3,"Assembly and packaging start with cutting a finished wafer—which contains dozens of chips in a grid pattern after fabrication—into separate chips. Each chip is mounted on a frame with wires that connect the chip to external devices, and enclosed in a protective casing. This produces the familiar look of a dark gray rectangle with metal pins at the edges."

Today, chips include billions of interconnected transistors and other electrical components. To manage this complexity, chip designers use complex EDA software to produce logic chip designs.

U.S. firms are currently the exclusive providers of EDA software with the full-spectrum capabilities needed by engineers at fabless firms and IDMs to design leading-edge chips. U.S. firms also dominate capabilities relevant to AI chip design, such as ASIC layouts.  Although the industry is top-heavy, startups frequently enter the EDA space. However, they struggle to compete with top EDA firms that typically acquire them to incorporate the startups’ niche functionality to their full-spectrum capabilities."
Core intellectual property,N85,material_resource,,,,,"Core IP consists of reusable, modular design blocks that chip design firms license for use in their designs. U.S. and U.K. vendors dominate the core IP market; some firms specialize exclusively on core IP, while others combine their offerings with EDA tools. ARM is the top core IP vendor, providing an instruction set architecture (ISA) and associated core IP underpinning most of the world’s smartphone processors."

CMP tools are critical for chip fabrication, but not as complex as other tools, such as lithography and deposition tools."
Deposition materials,N88,material_resource,,,,,"Deposition materials include materials such as sputtering targets, which are used in physical vapor deposition. In this process, argon ions are fired at the target, whose atoms are stripped off and deposited as a thin film on the wafer. Other deposition materials can be used to form interconnects, which are wires that connect devices within a chip, or for deposition of insulators that form layers within transistors and also between interconnects. Many materials used in deposition are also simply purified versions of raw materials such as aluminum, copper, tantalum, and titanium."
Chemical mechanical planarization materials,N90,material_resource,,,,,"The highest-value materials used in chemical mechanical planarization are chemical slurries, which often include rare earth minerals, and polishing pads.
