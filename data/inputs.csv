Electronic gases,N91,material_resource,,,"Gases are widely used in semiconductor fabrication, including common gases like nitrogen, hydrogen, helium, argon helium, and carbon dioxide as well as speciality electronic gases like nitrogen trifluoride, tungsten hexafluoride, hydrogen chloride, ammonia, disilane, germane, high-purity carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide. In particular, the photolithography process uses various noble gases, such as neon, argon, and krypton, to create lasers to draw circuit patterns on wafers. (However, the most advanced photolithography equipment, EUV, uses a tin light source rather than a gas-based light source.)",$6 billion,,[CSET](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/the-semiconductor-supply-chain/) (citing SEMI)

Packaging materials,N100,material_resource,,,"Semiconductor packaging involves several steps to bond a fabricated chip to an encasing package, each requiring different materials. For example, a bond wire, typically made of aluminum, copper, silver, or gold, attaches the chip to a lead frame. The lead frame transfers data between the chip and external devices. A protective ceramic package, plastic substrate, or encapsulant resin can also be bonded to the chip.  Die attach materials including polymers and eutectic alloys are used to attach the chip to packages or substrates.",,,
