# ETO Advanced Semiconductor Supply Chain Dataset

This folder contains csv files for the ETO Advanced Semiconductor Supply Chain Dataset. For more information, refer to the [dataset documentation](https://eto.tech/dataset-docs/chipexplorer).

Most of the data is taken from the CSET report _[The Semiconductor Supply Chain: Assessing National Competitiveness](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/the-semiconductor-supply-chain/)_, published in 2021. In 2022, ETO researchers augmented the company profiles in the data with information manually collected from producer websites and the open internet. For technical notes related to the conversion of the report into structured data, refer to the [technical notes](https://github.com/georgetown-cset/eto-supply-chain/blob/main/data/technical_notes.md).
